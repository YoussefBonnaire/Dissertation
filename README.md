# HW-Dissertation
This Project will track the progress of my work for my Heriot-Watt MSc in Data Science dissertation. Due to the size of the dataset, we were not able to keep track of the progress on GitHub, however, we maintained a version control environment using OneDrive. Unfortunately, because the data is not includable due to its size the python notebooks are not fully usable. However, they do highlight the code used during this project making them a valuable inclusion. 

Please find the visualisation of the dataset and the generated samples in the Visualisation folder. The data set can be provided upon request but does even zipped does not fit on this reposotory.
